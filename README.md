# MONS — Garanti BBVA "Genç Fikrinle Parla" Competition Brief

MONS Insights is an AI-powered financial behavior optimization engine that simplifies banking processes, increases financial efficiency, and enables preference-aware personalization — without interfering with users’ lifestyle choices.


The goal of MONS Insights is to simplify banking processes and optimize financial behavior by analyzing users’ existing financial flows — not their lifestyle decisions.
The system detects idle balances, recurring payment patterns, timing gaps, liquidity inefficiencies, and behavioral preferences.
It then provides frictionless, one-click actions that help users make better financial moves within their current habits.
At the same time, MONS generates structured preference data for the bank, enabling internal process optimization, smarter communication strategies, and culturally aware personalization.

# The Real Problem

Users already have financial habits.

But banking applications do not help them optimize within those habits.

### Example Scenario

* Salary received on the 5th
* Rent paid on the 25th
* Significant balance remains idle for 20 days
* No system detects this timing gap
* No intelligent suggestion is made
* No frictionless action shortcut is provided

The problem is not how users spend.

The problem is unused financial efficiency.

---

# The Solution: MONS Insights

MONS Insights adds an AI-powered intelligence layer to the top of the existing “Durumum” page.

It analyzes:

* Salary timing
* Recurring payments
* Idle balances
* Automation gaps
* Transaction patterns
* Behavioral signals
* Product interaction history

It then converts detected inefficiencies into:

* Clear financial insights
* One-click banking actions
* Context-aware notifications
* Process shortcuts

---

# Example Use Case: Liquidity Optimization

### Current Banking Experience

* 20,000 TL sits in a vadesiz account for 20 days
* No optimization suggestion
* No action shortcut

### MONS Experience

Dashboard Insight:

> “20,000 TL is idle for 20 days.
> Moving it to a short-term deposit could generate approximately X TL.”

CTA Button:
**“Move to 20-Day Deposit”**

User taps → Pre-filled amount → Deposit screen → Done.

No lifestyle change.
No behavioral judgment.
Just smarter banking.

---

# User-Facing Features

## 1. Liquidity Intelligence Cards

* Idle balance detection
* Short-term yield opportunities
* Deposit timing suggestions
* Early salary optimization insights

---

## 2. Automation Gap Detection

* Repeated manual bill payments
* Subscription detection
* Missed automation opportunities

Example:

> “You have manually paid your electricity bill for 9 months.
> Activate automatic payment in one tap.”

---

## 3. Timing Awareness & Cash Flow Signals

* Upcoming recurring payments
* Predicted liquidity pressure windows
* “Safe-to-use” balance estimation

---

## 4. Preference-Aware Personalization

MONS learns from behavior — not assumptions.

If a user:

* Explicitly declines interest-based products
* Avoids deposit products repeatedly
* Chooses participation banking options

Then the system:

* Reduces interest-based notifications
* Prioritizes gold, sukuk, and participation products
* Adapts campaign eligibility
* Displays preference flags in employee dashboard

This is not religious profiling.

This is behavioral signal processing.

---

## 5. Frictionless Process Simplification

Every insight includes:

* A direct action button
* Pre-filled forms
* Reduced navigation steps

The goal is not only insight — but execution.

---

# Bank-Side Intelligence Layer

MONS Insights is a two-sided system.

It generates structured behavioral metadata for internal use.

## Generated Metadata Examples

* Liquidity tolerance level
* Interest sensitivity indicator
* Automation preference score
* Risk appetite (behavioral, not survey-based)
* Engagement frequency
* Short-term vs long-term balance behavior

---

## Operational Benefits

### 1. Smarter Campaign Targeting

* Reduced irrelevant notifications
* Higher open and conversion rates

### 2. Branch & Call Center Preparation

Employee dashboard shows:

* Behavioral profile summary
* Product alignment suggestions
* Interest sensitivity indicator
* Automation readiness level

This reduces:

* Guesswork
* Interaction time
* Mismatched product offers

---

### 3. CRM Intelligence Enhancement

MONS turns raw transaction data into structured insight.

Instead of:

“Customer balance: 42,000 TL”

It becomes:

“Customer keeps 15–25k TL idle for 18 days every month.”

This transforms internal decision-making.

---

# Cultural & Ethical Sensitivity

MONS does not:

* Infer religion
* Make moral judgments
* Force product directions

It only responds to:

* Explicit product behavior
* Repeated interaction patterns
* Declared preferences

The system respects:

* Financial conservatism
* Interest sensitivity
* Cultural saving behaviors

And adapts communication accordingly.

---

# Strategic Fit with Garanti BBVA

MONS Insights:

* Builds on existing transaction data infrastructure
* Does not require radical architectural change
* Complements UGI (UGI = Q&A, MONS = proactive intelligence)
* Enhances CRM systems
* Supports AI-driven personalization strategy

It transforms the “Durumum” page from:

Passive balance display

Into:

Active financial optimization interface.
